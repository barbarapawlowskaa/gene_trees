# Phylogenetic Tree Comparison Project: 16S rRNA vs. TimeTree Data
This repository contains the scripts and results for a comparative bioinformatics analysis, focusing on the phylogenetic relationships of 10 diverse bacterial species. The project aims to compare a Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree built from 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences with a TimeTree based on estimated species divergence times.
